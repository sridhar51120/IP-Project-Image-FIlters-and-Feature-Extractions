    Contrast stretching, also known as contrast enhancement or normalization, is a simple image processing technique
    used to improve the contrast in an image. It works by stretching the range of intensity values in an image so that
    the full range from minimum to maximum values is utilized. This can make dark areas of an image darker and bright
    areas brighter, effectively enhancing the overall visual quality.

<p>
    Here's a brief overview of how contrast stretching works:

    Find the minimum and maximum pixel values in the image.
    Apply a linear transformation to the pixel values to stretch them to the full range of intensity values (usually 0
    to 255 for an 8-bit image).
</p>
<p>
    import cv2
    import numpy as np

    # Load an image
    image = cv2.imread('input_image.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

    # Find the minimum and maximum pixel values
    min_val = np.min(image)
    max_val = np.max(image)

    # Apply contrast stretching
    stretched_image = np.uint8((image - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) * 255)

    # Save the stretched image
    cv2.imwrite('stretched_image.jpg', stretched_image)

    # Display the original and stretched images (optional)
    cv2.imshow('Original Image', image)
    cv2.imshow('Stretched Image', stretched_image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    <!--  -->
</p>
<p>
    In this code:

We load an input grayscale image using cv2.imread.
We find the minimum and maximum pixel values in the image using np.min and np.max.
We apply the contrast stretching formula to each pixel in the image.
Finally, we save the stretched image and optionally display both the original and stretched images using OpenCV.

    Make sure to replace 'input_image.jpg' with the path to your own input image file. This code is for grayscale images; if you want to apply contrast stretching to color images, you'll need to modify it accordingly.
