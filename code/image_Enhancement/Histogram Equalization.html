<h1>
    Histogram Equalization is a technique used in image processing to enhance the contrast of an image by redistributing
    the intensity levels of pixels in such a way that the histogram of the resulting image is approximately uniform.
    This can be particularly useful when dealing with images that have poor contrast, making it easier to identify
    details and features.
</h1>

<p>
    Here's a brief overview of how histogram equalization works:
    Compute the histogram of the input image: The histogram represents the distribution of pixel intensities in the
    image.

    Compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the histogram: This is done by accumulating the histogram
    values. The CDF represents the mapping of pixel intensities from the input image to the output image.

    Normalize the CDF: Scale the CDF values to map them to the desired output intensity range (usually 0-255 for an
    8-bit image).

    Apply the mapping to the input image: Replace each pixel's intensity value with its corresponding value from the
    normalized CDF.

    import cv2
    import numpy as np

    # Load the input image
    input_image = cv2.imread('input.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

    # Compute the histogram of the input image
    histogram = cv2.calcHist([input_image], [0], None, [256], [0, 256])

    # Compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
    cdf = histogram.cumsum()

    # Normalize the CDF to map to the output intensity range (0-255)
    cdf_normalized = cdf * 255 / cdf[-1]

    # Apply the mapping to the input image using the CDF
    output_image = cv2.LUT(input_image, cdf_normalized.astype(np.uint8))

    # Save the output image
    cv2.imwrite('output.jpg', output_image)

    # Display the input and output images
    cv2.imshow('Input Image', input_image)
    cv2.imshow('Output Image', output_image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

    In this code:

    We load an input grayscale image using cv2.imread and specify the cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE flag to read it as a
    grayscale image.
    We compute the histogram using cv2.calcHist.
    The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is calculated using cumsum.
    The CDF is normalized to the 0-255 range.
    The CDF is applied to the input image using the cv2.LUT function.
    The output image is saved and displayed.
