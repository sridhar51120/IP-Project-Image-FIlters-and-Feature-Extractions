<h1>
    Gamma correction is a technique used in image processing and computer graphics to adjust the brightness and contrast
    of an image. It involves applying a nonlinear operation to the pixel values of an image to compensate for the
    nonlinear response of the human visual system to changes in brightness. Gamma correction is typically used to make
    images appear more visually pleasing by adjusting their tonal characteristics.
</h1>

<p>
    The gamma correction formula is:

    corrected_pixel_value = original_pixel_value ^ (1 / gamma)
</p>

<p>
    Where:

    corrected_pixel_value is the adjusted pixel value.
    original_pixel_value is the pixel value before gamma correction.
    gamma is the gamma value, which is typically between 0.5 and 2.0. A gamma value less than 1.0 darkens the image,
    while a gamma value greater than 1.0 brightens the image.
</p>
<p>
    import cv2
    import numpy as np

    def gamma_correction(image, gamma):
    # Apply gamma correction formula
    corrected_image = np.power(image, 1.0 / gamma)

    # Clip pixel values to the valid range [0, 255]
    corrected_image = np.clip(corrected_image, 0, 255).astype(np.uint8)

    return corrected_image

    # Load an image
    image = cv2.imread('input.jpg')

    # Set the gamma value (e.g., 1.5 for brightening, 0.7 for darkening)
    gamma_value = 1.5

    # Apply gamma correction
    corrected_image = gamma_correction(image, gamma_value)

    # Display the original and corrected images
    cv2.imshow('Original Image', image)
    cv2.imshow('Gamma Corrected Image', corrected_image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

</p>

<p>
    In this code:

    We load an input image using OpenCV.
    We define a gamma_correction function that applies gamma correction to the image.
    The gamma-corrected image is then displayed alongside the original image.
</p>

<p>
    You can adjust the gamma_value to control the degree of correction (values less than 1.0 for darkening and values
    greater than 1.0 for brightening). This code uses the OpenCV library for image processing, so make sure to install
    OpenCV (cv2) if you haven't already using a package manager like pip.
