    Spatial filtering is a common technique in image processing used to enhance or modify the appearance of an image by
    applying a filter or kernel to the image's pixel values. Two common types of spatial filtering are sharpening and
    smoothing.

<p>
    Sharpening:

    Sharpening is used to enhance the edges and fine details in an image, making it appear more defined.
    It involves applying a high-pass filter to emphasize the differences in pixel values between neighboring pixels.
    The most common sharpening filter is the Laplacian filter or the Sobel filter.
    Smoothing:

    Smoothing, also known as blurring, is used to reduce noise in an image or to create a smoother appearance.
    It involves applying a low-pass filter to average or blur neighboring pixel values.
    The most common smoothing filter is the Gaussian filter.

    import cv2
    import numpy as np

    # Load an image
    image = cv2.imread('input_image.jpg')

    # Sharpening using Laplacian filter
    sharpened_image = cv2.Laplacian(image, cv2.CV_64F)
    sharpened_image = np.uint8(np.absolute(sharpened_image))

    # Smoothing using Gaussian filter
    smoothed_image = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (5, 5), 0)

    # Display the original, sharpened, and smoothed images
    cv2.imshow('Original Image', image)
    cv2.imshow('Sharpened Image', sharpened_image)
    cv2.imshow('Smoothed Image', smoothed_image)

    # Save the results
    cv2.imwrite('sharpened_image.jpg', sharpened_image)
    cv2.imwrite('smoothed_image.jpg', smoothed_image)

    Spatial filtering is a common technique in image processing used to enhance or modify the appearance of an image by
    applying a filter or kernel to the image's pixel values. Two common types of spatial filtering are sharpening and
    smoothing.

    Sharpening:

    Sharpening is used to enhance the edges and fine details in an image, making it appear more defined.
    It involves applying a high-pass filter to emphasize the differences in pixel values between neighboring pixels.
    The most common sharpening filter is the Laplacian filter or the Sobel filter.
    Smoothing:

    Smoothing, also known as blurring, is used to reduce noise in an image or to create a smoother appearance.
    It involves applying a low-pass filter to average or blur neighboring pixel values.
    The most common smoothing filter is the Gaussian filter.
    Here's a brief example of how to perform sharpening and smoothing using Python with the OpenCV library:

    python
    Copy code
    import cv2
    import numpy as np

    # Load an image
    image = cv2.imread('input_image.jpg')

    # Sharpening using Laplacian filter
    sharpened_image = cv2.Laplacian(image, cv2.CV_64F)
    sharpened_image = np.uint8(np.absolute(sharpened_image))

    # Smoothing using Gaussian filter
    smoothed_image = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (5, 5), 0)

    # Display the original, sharpened, and smoothed images
    cv2.imshow('Original Image', image)
    cv2.imshow('Sharpened Image', sharpened_image)
    cv2.imshow('Smoothed Image', smoothed_image)

    # Save the results
    cv2.imwrite('sharpened_image.jpg', sharpened_image)
    cv2.imwrite('smoothed_image.jpg', smoothed_image)

    # Wait for a key press and then close all windows
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    In this code:

    We use OpenCV to load an image.
    To sharpen the image, we apply the Laplacian filter using cv2.Laplacian and convert the result to an unsigned 8-bit
    integer image.
    To smooth the image, we use the Gaussian filter with a kernel size of (5, 5) and a standard deviation of 0.
    We display the original, sharpened, and smoothed images using cv2.imshow.
    Finally, we save the sharpened and smoothed images and wait for a key press to close the display windows.

    Make sure to replace 'input_image.jpg' with the path to your input image. You may need to install OpenCV if you
    haven't already using pip install opencv-python.
