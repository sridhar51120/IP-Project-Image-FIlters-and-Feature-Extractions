    Region growing is a segmentation technique in image processing and computer vision that is used to partition an
    image into meaningful regions based on certain criteria or characteristics. The basic idea behind region growing is
    to start with one or more seed points and iteratively grow a region by adding neighboring pixels that meet certain
    similarity criteria. This process continues until no more pixels can be added to the region, ensuring that regions
    are homogeneous in some way (e.g., they have similar intensity values).

    Here's a brief overview of the region growing algorithm:

    Initialization: Choose one or more seed points from the image to start the region growing process.

    Criteria for Growing: Define a similarity criterion that determines whether a neighboring pixel should be added to
    the current region. This criterion could be based on intensity values, color, texture, or any other relevant image
    features.

    Region Growing: Start with the seed point(s) and iteratively add neighboring pixels that satisfy the similarity
    criterion to the region. This can be done using a recursive approach or a queue-based approach.

    Termination: The region growing process stops when no more pixels can be added to the region (i.e., when neighboring
    pixels do not meet the similarity criterion). The region is then considered complete.

    Repeat: If needed, you can repeat the region growing process for other seed points or with different similarity
    criteria to segment the image into multiple regions.
