    Edge detection is a fundamental image processing technique used to identify boundaries within an image. It's crucial for various computer vision tasks, such as object recognition, image segmentation, and more. Two popular edge detection algorithms are the Canny edge detector and the Sobel operator. Here's a brief overview of each, along with Python code examples:

<p>
    Canny Edge Detector:

    The Canny edge detector is a multi-stage algorithm known for its ability to detect edges accurately while reducing noise. It involves the following steps:
    
    Gaussian Smoothing: Reduce noise in the image by applying a Gaussian blur.
    Gradient Calculation: Compute the gradient magnitude and direction.
    Non-maximum Suppression: Suppress non-maximum values to keep only local maxima.
    Edge Tracking by Hysteresis: Detect and connect edges by thresholding.

<p>
    import cv2

# Load an image
image = cv2.imread('image.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

# Apply Gaussian blur
blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (5, 5), 0)

# Apply Canny edge detection
edges = cv2.Canny(blurred, 100, 200)  # Adjust the threshold values as needed

# Display the result
cv2.imshow('Canny Edges', edges)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

</p>

<h1>
    Sobel Operator:

The Sobel operator is a simple and widely used edge detection filter. It calculates the gradient of the image at each pixel and highlights areas of rapid intensity change, which typically correspond to edges. It's available as both a horizontal and vertical operator.

<p>
    import cv2

# Load an image
image = cv2.imread('image.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

# Apply Sobel operator
sobel_x = cv2.Sobel(image, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=3)  # Horizontal gradient
sobel_y = cv2.Sobel(image, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=3)  # Vertical gradient

# Compute the magnitude of the gradient
gradient_magnitude = cv2.magnitude(sobel_x, sobel_y)

# Apply a threshold to highlight edges
thresholded_edges = cv2.threshold(gradient_magnitude, 100, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)[1]

# Display the result
cv2.imshow('Sobel Edges', thresholded_edges)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

    Both Canny and Sobel edge detection techniques have their advantages and are used in different applications. Experiment with the parameters and choose the one that suits your specific image processing needs.
