Clustering is a machine learning technique used to group similar data points together based on certain similarity criteria. One of the most popular clustering algorithms is K-Means clustering. Here's a brief overview of K-Means clustering and a Python code example to demonstrate its implementation:

K-Means Clustering:

K-Means is a partitioning method that aims to partition a dataset into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean value. The algorithm proceeds through the following steps:

Initialization: Randomly select K initial centroids (points representing the cluster centers).

Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming K clusters.

Update: Recalculate the centroids as the mean of all data points in each cluster.

Repeat Assignment and Update: Reassign data points to the nearest centroids and update centroids iteratively until convergence (i.e., when centroids no longer change significantly) or until a predefined number of iterations.
