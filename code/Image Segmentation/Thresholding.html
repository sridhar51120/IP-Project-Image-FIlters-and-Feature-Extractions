    Thresholding is a simple yet powerful image processing technique used to separate objects or regions of interest from the background in an image. It works by converting a grayscale or color image into a binary image, where pixels are classified as either foreground (object) or background based on a specified threshold value. Pixels with intensity values above the threshold are considered foreground, while those below the threshold are considered background.

    Here's a brief overview of thresholding:

    Global Thresholding: In global thresholding, a single threshold value is applied to the entire image. Pixels with intensity values greater than or equal to the threshold are classified as foreground, while those below the threshold are considered background.
    
    Local Thresholding: Local thresholding, also known as adaptive thresholding, calculates a threshold value for each pixel based on its local neighborhood. This approach is useful for images with varying lighting conditions.

    import cv2
    import numpy as np
    
    # Load an image in grayscale
    image = cv2.imread('image.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    
    # Set a global threshold value (e.g., 128)
    threshold_value = 128
    
    # Apply global thresholding
    _, binary_image = cv2.threshold(image, threshold_value, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
    
    # Display the original and binary images
    cv2.imshow('Original Image', image)
    cv2.imshow('Binary Image', binary_image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

    In this code:

cv2.imread loads the image in grayscale.
cv2.threshold applies global thresholding, converting the image into a binary image. The cv2.THRESH_BINARY flag specifies the binary thresholding mode.
You can adjust the threshold_value to control the sensitivity of the thresholding operation. Different images may require different threshold values to obtain the desired segmentation results.

For adaptive/local thresholding, you can use functions like cv2.adaptiveThreshold to calculate adaptive thresholds for each pixel based on its neighborhood.
