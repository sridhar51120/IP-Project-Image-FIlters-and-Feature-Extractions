<h1>
    Inpainting is a computer vision and image processing technique used to fill in missing or corrupted regions in an
    image with plausible content. It is often used for image restoration, object removal, and image editing tasks. The
    goal is to generate visually coherent and realistic results by inferring the missing or corrupted information based
    on the surrounding context.

<p>
    Inpainting Techniques:

    Exemplar-based Inpainting: This approach involves copying and pasting pixels from nearby regions to fill in the
    missing or corrupted area. It relies on finding similar patches in the image and using them as references.

    Patch-Based Inpainting: Similar to exemplar-based inpainting, patch-based methods use patches from the surrounding
    regions to fill in the missing parts. Various algorithms, such as texture synthesis and patch matching, are used for
    this purpose.

    Deep Learning-based Inpainting: Deep neural networks, especially Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and
    Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been employed for inpainting tasks. These models can learn to generate
    realistic content based on the surrounding context.

    import cv2
    import numpy as np

    # Load the image with missing or corrupted regions
    image = cv2.imread('corrupted_image.jpg')

    # Create a mask to specify the missing or corrupted area
    mask = cv2.imread('mask.jpg', 0)

    # Perform inpainting
    inpainting_result = cv2.inpaint(image, mask, inpaintRadius=3, flags=cv2.INPAINT_TELEA)

    # Display the original image, mask, and inpainted result
    cv2.imshow('Original Image', image)
    cv2.imshow('Mask', mask)
    cv2.imshow('Inpainting Result', inpainting_result)

    # Wait for a key press and close windows
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

</p>
<p>
    In this code:

    cv2.imread is used to load the original image and mask.
    cv2.inpaint performs the inpainting operation using the specified mask and inpainting method (cv2.INPAINT_TELEA in
    this case).
    The inpainting result is displayed alongside the original image and mask using cv2.imshow.

    Make sure to replace 'corrupted_image.jpg' and 'mask.jpg' with the paths to your own image and mask files.
    Additionally, you can experiment with different inpainting methods and parameters for better results depending on
    your specific inpainting task.
