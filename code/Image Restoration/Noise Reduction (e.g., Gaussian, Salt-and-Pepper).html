    Noise reduction techniques are used in image processing and signal processing to remove unwanted noise or
    disturbances from data. Two common types of noise are Gaussian noise and Salt-and-Pepper noise. Here, I'll provide a
    brief overview of these noises and show you how to perform noise reduction using Python with some simple code
    examples.

<p>
    Gaussian Noise:

    Gaussian noise is a type of statistical noise that follows a Gaussian distribution (normal distribution). It is
    characterized by random variations in intensity and appears as a smooth, continuous pattern.
    Commonly used in digital images, Gaussian noise can be caused by factors such as sensor imperfections or electronic
    interference.

<p>

    import cv2
    import numpy as np

    # Load the noisy image
    noisy_image = cv2.imread('noisy_image.jpg')

    # Apply Gaussian blur for noise reduction
    denoised_image = cv2.GaussianBlur(noisy_image, (5, 5), 0)

    # Save the denoised image
    cv2.imwrite('denoised_image.jpg', denoised_image)

</p>

<p>
    Salt-and-Pepper Noise:

    Salt-and-Pepper noise is a type of impulse noise that appears as random black and white pixels in an image. These
    pixels have extremely low or high intensity values.
    Salt-and-Pepper noise can be introduced by faulty sensors, transmission errors, or other external factors.
</p>

<p>
    import cv2
    import numpy as np

    # Load the noisy image
    noisy_image = cv2.imread('noisy_image.jpg')

    # Apply median filtering for noise reduction
    denoised_image = cv2.medianBlur(noisy_image, 3) # Adjust kernel size as needed

    # Save the denoised image
    cv2.imwrite('denoised_image.jpg', denoised_image)

</p>

<p>
    In both examples, we load a noisy image, apply a specific noise reduction technique using OpenCV (GaussianBlur for
    Gaussian noise and medianBlur for Salt-and-Pepper noise), and save the denoised image. You can adjust the
    parameters, such as the kernel size, to fine-tune the noise reduction process according to your specific needs.
