    Deblurring is a process of removing or reducing the blur or distortion present in an image. There are several
    techniques for image deblurring, and two commonly used methods are the Wiener deconvolution and the Richardson-Lucy
    deconvolution.

    Wiener Deconvolution:
    Wiener deconvolution is a technique used to restore images that have been blurred by a known linear system. It is
    based on the Wiener filter, which aims to minimize the mean squared error between the estimated image and the true
    image. The Wiener deconvolution takes into account both the blurring function (point spread function) and the noise
    present in the image.

<p>
    import cv2
    import numpy as np

    # Load the blurred image and the point spread function (PSF)
    blurred_image = cv2.imread('blurred_image.png', 0)
    psf = cv2.imread('psf.png', 0)

    # Perform Wiener deconvolution
    restored_image = cv2.warpDeconvolve(blurred_image, psf, lambda_=0.01)

    # Display the restored image
    cv2.imshow('Restored Image', restored_image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

    Richardson-Lucy Deconvolution:
    Richardson-Lucy deconvolution is an iterative method for deblurring images. It is particularly useful when the point
    spread function is not known precisely. This algorithm iteratively estimates the original image by refining an
    initial guess.

    Here's a Python code example using the scikit-image library for Richardson-Lucy deconvolution:
</h1>

<p>
    from skimage import color, data, restoration
    import numpy as np

    # Load the blurred image
    blurred_image = data.coins()

    # Perform Richardson-Lucy deconvolution
    psf = np.ones((5, 5)) / 25.0 # Example PSF
    restored_image = restoration.richardson_lucy(blurred_image, psf, iterations=30)

    # Display the original and restored images
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 4))
    ax[0].imshow(blurred_image, cmap='gray')
    ax[0].set_title('Blurred Image')
    ax[1].imshow(restored_image, cmap='gray')
    ax[1].set_title('Restored Image')
    plt.show()
